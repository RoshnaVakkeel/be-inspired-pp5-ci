## Agile Methodology
Throughout this project, an agile approach was taken in order to develop the website  Each activity was broken down into  manageable actions from initially creating 4 Epics, which were then broken down into smaller User Stories. Each of the user stories then had different acceptance criteria. The status, comments and details of each Epic along with the associated User Stories can be found in the kanban board linked [here](https://github.com/users/RoshnaVakkeel/projects/3). This made the overall project much more manageable to build. 

## Epics and User Stories
8 Epics were created which were further developed into 37 User Stories. The initial conception was done using google sheets. The link can be found [here](docs/agile/epics_and_user_stories_list_be_inspired.xlsx).

## Acceptance Criteria
For all the User Stories, Acceptance Criteria were enlisted. The purpose of this was to provide a reference point for the developmental steps. I made sure to cross-check that all the required steps intended was implemented. It also helped with Testing to make sure that all the necessary aspects and features were covered. The acceptance criteria is described on the column next to the user stories (column H) [here](docs/agile/epics_and_user_stories_list_be_inspired.xlsx).

### Tasks
The tasks for the website development process was closely followed as mentioned in CI's Advanced Frontend React module "I Moments" walkthrough project. The task is generally the developers step towards preparing the app.
The tasks that I have followed during the development phase were carried out in this order.

**Before Project Inception**

- Design Entity Relationship Diagram 
- Set up and create  Back End API. For this backend was built using the Django Rest API framework. All information can be found in [BE INSPIRED - DRF API](https://github.com/RoshnaVakkeel/be-inspired-drf-api)

- Create Frontend Repository in GitHub
- Create Project, Epics, User Stories and prepare Kanban Board

**Creation of Project in GitPod**

- Set up ReactJS project
- Install dependencies
- Coding
- Testing

### User Story Management

#### Sprints
The project was divided mainly into three main sprints spanning a week.

- **Sprint 1** was to set up Backend be-inspired-drf-api.

- **Sprint 2** was to set up Frontend ReactJS app and connect with backend API (Faced tough challenges, details in Errors and Fix section)
	- Set up axios interceptors, create async handles and connect to backend.
	- Set up Sign Up and Sign In pages
	- Make forms in fronend, input data and push data into be-inspired-drf-api

## Design

### Colours
- The colour scheme has considered based on easy accessibility for all. 
- Complimentarity was key feature in color selection, to give it a pleasant feel for all age groups.
- The colors have been rendered differently for posts and recommendations, so that user can easily distinguish between them.

The palette was generated with inspiration from palettes provided by [Coolers](https://coolors.co/). Simple combinaion of pastel colours were checked and selected. The color palette used is as shown below.
![Color palette](docs/wireframes/be_inspired_color_palette.png)

### Typography

Fonts were imported using Google Fonts. Font "Alegreya Sans" was used throughout with a backup of sans-serif. It was chosen for easy readability for users. 

### Imagery

The imagery on the website has been seleced according to the post requirement.
Many images were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

### Wireframes
The wireframes were generated at the start of the project suing Balsamiq. After referring to different bootstrap templates, pages were divided into the different relevant sections. 
The finished website closely follows wireframes as the designs were adapted during development but overall structure was kept constant. For eg. an additional 'Liked' page was introduced in order to allo the user to save the posts they liked. 

The wireframes can be found in these links:<br>
[Wireframes for Desktop](docs/wireframes/wireframes_be_inspired_desktop.pdf)<br>
[Wireframes for Tablet](docs/wireframes/wireframes_be_inspired_tablet.pdf)<br>

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs

**Frameworks and Libraries**
- [React Bootstrap4](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/) - for styling the site and site responsiveness across various devices
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - to build the functionality of the site
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - to add various icons to the site
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - used for promise-based HTTP. axios was used to send API requests from the React project to the be_inspired_drf_api and avoid any CORS errors when sending cookies.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - library to decode out JSON Web token. JWT prevents unauthenticated user from making extra network requests to refresh their access token. It is also used to remove the timestamp from the browser when the user refreshes token expires or the user logs out.
- [Popper](https://popper.js.org/) - a 3rd party library used by React-Bootstrap to make sure the dropdown menus position is fixed on all browsers.
- [React Infinite Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) - to enable component to load content (posts, recommendations and comments) automatically as the user scrolls towards the bottom of the page without having to jump to next/previous page.
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - used for dynamic routing. This library enables the navigation among views of various components and control what the user can see depending on the URL they have accessed in the browser.

## Production

Installations:

- React library - using the command `npx create-react-app . --template git+https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/cra-template-moments.git --use-npm`
For the React project set up
- react-bootstrap - using the command `npm install react-bootstrap@1.6.3 bootstrap@4.6.0`
This is used to render the layout and styling of the website. The library makes it easy to create and use standard interface elements that are responsive.
- react-router-dom - using the command `npm install react-router-dom@5.3.0`
 This library makes the site navigation easier without the need to refresh the page. In social media sites ith mutiple components, it provides a quick and responsive user experience.
- axios - installed using command `npm install axios`.It manages the calls to the backend database. Simplifies the API requestsand the included interceptors refresh JSON Web Tokens which the site uses.
- infinite-scroll-component - installed using command ` npm install react-infinite-scroll-component`.
It is used to enable infinite scrolling on the Posts and Recommendations components and on comments. Infinite scrolling is a standard feature in all social media sites.
- jwt decode - Using command `npm install jwt-decode`. Used to remove requests to refresh an access token for signed out users. It enables the refresh token to be decoded so that a timestamp can be put in local storage, if a timestamp does not exist in the user's local storage then access refresh requests will not be made.

## Issues and Fixes

Issue 1: NavBar won't update

When user signs up and signs in, the NavBar didn't update. It stayed in logged out view. The reason was that the access token key generated by the backend wouldn't reach frontend. It wasn't obseved in the console. I was getting the error: ...herokuapp.com/dj-rest-auth/user/ 401 (Unauthorized). 
This is the link to the issue: [Link](docs/issues/NavBar_update_issue.pdf)

Fix: (Thanks to Sean from Tutor support, CI)

Installed old version of dj-rest-auth==2.1.9 and the access token was seen in the console.
Reason: As I installed the versions suggested in Moments App for React using `npx create-react-app . --template git+https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/cra-template-moments.git --use-npm`.  The dj-rest-auth version installed for backend drf-api was 3.0.0. It should be dj-rest-auth==2.1.9. This caused the NavBar logged-in or logged-out view to fail upon signing in.  The fix is: At the terminal of backend drf-api, install dj-rest-auth using `pip3 install dj-rest-auth==2.1.9` . Then git add and push and deploy using Heroku. 

Issue 2: Cloudinary profile picture 404 error

Upon any new user was created, there was an [error 404 observed in the console](docs/issues/cloudinary_console_error.pdf). 

Fix: 

The issue was due to the wrong destination path of the profile and post default images. I saved the files inside /images/ folder, where all the uploaded images get saved. I needed to place the default files in the root directory. This solved my error.

Issue 3: User stays signed in after signing out

When a user signs in, sign in is successful and I get an access token and a refreshTokenTimeStamp in Application, local storage. When a user signs out, sign out is successful and the local storage shows the refreshTokenTimeStamp is gone. But upon page refresh, the previous user automatically sign in.
Details can be found [here](docs/issues/user_signs_in_on_page_refresh.pdf)

Fix: As mentioned in the backend drf-api deployment section, "dj-rest-auth has a bug that doesnâ€™t allow users to log out. One way to fix this issue is to have our own logout view, where we set both cookies to an empty string and pass additional attributes like secure, httponly and samesite, which was left out by mistake by the library." I missed adding the path of logout url in drf project's urls.py file. Adding path for logout route solved the issue.

## Testing

### User Story Testing

 - All the User Stories in the [User Experience (UX)](#user-experience-ux) enlisted had different Acceptance Criteria. 
 - Acceptance Criteria mentions the key features that needed to design and create the user experience as expected. 
 - User stories were matched with the features and were cross-checked whether all the features as per the mentioned criteria exists in the website.
 - All Criteria got a pass as result 
 This excel document shows the list of Acceptance Criteria, the matching features and the links to the features: [User Story Testing](docs/testing/user_story_testing_be_inspired.xlsx)

 **User's Testing Experience**

This testing consisted of checking:
- The website functioned as expected
- Working of all the links
- Submission of posts, recommendations and comments
- Edit and delete functions
- Sign Up, Sign in and Sign Out features Testing

**User's Testing Feedback Implementation**
There are a number of accounts were created by different users using differnet devices. Many quoted the mobile browser incompatibilty upon signing in. In Django Admin, the user registration was seen. 

My personal experience was the same. In order to be able to test the full sign in functionality on Safari, the "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking" needed to be turned off in the browser settings. Then  it worked. This is because if this isn't done, the cookies are not saved and access tokens are not refreshed. This means a user can be created however, the sign in functionality doesn't work. 

An error was spotted that upon clicking cancel option in post and recommendation edit option, the form was still getting submitted. Issue was that the type was by mistake written as "submit". That was removed and the issue was fixed.


### Browser Compatibility

- The website was manually tested the website on 3 different browsers: Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge (Desktop) and Safari(mobile phone). In all the browsers the website functions very well and all the features work similarly. 


**Responsiveness in different device sizes**
In addition, I also tested it on my own mobile with Safari search engine, and had a number of friends and family test it on their phones, tablets and laptops. 
The pages render well in all the devices in a responsive manner.

### Manual Testing
I manually tested all the features of the website making sure to go through them with different browsers and device sizes. I also checked the features of the site against the original user stories and compared them with the acceptance Criteria. All the tests were recorded using LICEcap tool.

The aspects considered while testing:
- CRUD functionality for Posts, Recommendations, Comments, Likes, Follows and Profile on both the development and deployed version of the site.
- All Nav links open on the correct page
- Page responsiveness
- Authentication works displaying a different set of options for logged-in users compared to logged-out
- Not found pages display correctly when a non-existent URL when entered

The sections below presents an exhaustive list of manual tests done. The gifs show the functionalities and responsiveness. Many files have been used in Features section as well.

### Validation

#### W3C Validator 

The [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML of the website. No errors were identified. The error "Percentage ("%") is not followed by two hexadecimal digits" was filtered out.

Result is as shown [here](docs/testing/w3c_validator_html.png)


#### W3C Jigsaw Validator 

The official W3C Markup Validator was used to validate the CSS in the project.

[W3C CSS Jigsaw Validatior](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator)

All CSS code passed through the validator without any issues.

### JSX Validation using ESLint

Full Report can be found [here](docs/testing/ESLint_validation_report.pdf).

The JSX code was validated using the ESLint utility. As my fellow students spoke about configuring ESLint using GitPod gave issues, I decided to download my project and run it locally in Visual Studio Code editor. I installed the Eslint package again and tested all js modules using command `npx eslint filename.js`.

Settings used:
Check syntax and find problems
JavaScript modules (import/export)
React
JavaScript export/import
Does not use TypeScript
Runs in node
JSON as config

Following errors were seen:
1. Prop type validation error:
	- Error about validating the data types for props passed in to components.
	- This is a an error about validating the data types for props passed in to components. Although the use of data types is an important check for code reusability, ignoring data types in a project of this size and complexity is ok. However, for components to be truly reusable, data type validation is an important check. [Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38684925/react-eslint-error-missing-in-props-validation)
	- These were ignored as for a project of this size and complexity it is ok. 

2. Do not pass children as props warning for Infinite Scroll component: This warning was ignored since it is part of the implementation for the InfiniteScroll component.
	- It is part of the implementation for the InfiniteScroll component as shon in walkthrough.
	- It was ignored

3. Error in DropdownMenu.js - component-definition-is-missing-display-name 
	- Credit: [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-component-definition-missing-display-name-react-display-name-error-occur-JavaScript-HTML-arrays-reactjs-antd-development)
	- Reason: ESLint thinks you are defining a new component without setting any name to it.

	This is explained because ESLint cannot recognise the render prop pattern because you are not directly writing this render prop into a component, but into an object.

	You can either put the render prop directly into your jsx implementation of the component, or shut down the ESLint's error by doing this :

	// eslint-disable-next-line react/display-name

	OR

	If anyone needs to avoid this in all the files, add below to the rules section of .eslintrc.js file,

	{ 
	... 
	"rules": { 
		"react/display-name": "off" 
	} 
	} 

 4. An error about unescaped characters (in this case an apostrophe) was ignored as using the escaped character sequence suggested resulted in the apostrophe not displaying on the test server.
	- File: LandingPage.js

There were no other syntax errors observed. 

### Learning Resources
- The codes are heavily dependent on ['Moments'](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Solutions/moments) walkthrough that was provided by Code Institute. Though it was used as a foundation, extra functionalities have been added to make this project truly my own. Code Institute has been credited throughout my code where applicable using docstrings. I have built my own styles and added extra functionality, such as filtering of posts based on their category, Recommendations page, Feedback messages and landing page. The major issue behind not bringing in more features was the time limit.
- Other CI students projects being referred include:
	- [Buzz of Berlin](https://github.com/vkleer/ci-pp5-buzz-of-berlin/)
	- [Gamer Verse](https://github.com/Jbachtiger/ci-pp5-gamer-verse/)
	- [Snapfood](https://github.com/aleksandracodes/ci_pp5_snapfood/)
	- [Quizle](https://github.com/adamhatton/quizle/)
