## Agile Methodology

## Acceptance Criteria
For all the User Stories, Acceptance Criteria were enlisted. The purpose of this was to provide a reference point for the developmental steps. I made sure to cross-check that all the required steps intended was implemented. It also helped with Testing to make sure that all the necessary aspects and features were covered. The acceptance criteria is described on the column next to the user stories (column H) [here]().

### Tasks
The tasks for the website development process was closely followed as mentioned in CI's Advanced Frontend React module "I Moments" walkthrough project. The task is generally the developers step towards preparing the app.
The tasks that I have followed during the development phase were carried out in this order.
