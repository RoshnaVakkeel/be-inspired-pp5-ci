## Agile Methodology
Throughout this project, an agile approach was taken in order to develop the website  Each activity was broken down into  manageable actions from initially creating 4 Epics, which were then broken down into smaller User Stories. Each of the user stories then had different acceptance criteria. The status, comments and details of each Epic along with the associated User Stories can be found in the kanban board linked [here](https://github.com/users/RoshnaVakkeel/projects/3). This made the overall project much more manageable to build. 

## Epics and User Stories
8 Epics were created which were further developed into 37 User Stories. The initial conception was done using google sheets. The link can be found [here](docs/agile/epics_and_user_stories_list_be_inspired.xlsx).

## Acceptance Criteria
For all the User Stories, Acceptance Criteria were enlisted. The purpose of this was to provide a reference point for the developmental steps. I made sure to cross-check that all the required steps intended was implemented. It also helped with Testing to make sure that all the necessary aspects and features were covered. The acceptance criteria is described on the column next to the user stories (column H) [here](docs/agile/epics_and_user_stories_list_be_inspired.xlsx).

### Tasks
The tasks for the website development process was closely followed as mentioned in CI's Advanced Frontend React module "I Moments" walkthrough project. The task is generally the developers step towards preparing the app.
The tasks that I have followed during the development phase were carried out in this order.

**Before Project Inception**

- Design Entity Relationship Diagram 
- Set up and create  Back End API. For this backend was built using the Django Rest API framework. All information can be found in [BE INSPIRED - DRF API](https://github.com/RoshnaVakkeel/be-inspired-drf-api)

- Create Frontend Repository in GitHub
- Create Project, Epics, User Stories and prepare Kanban Board

**Creation of Project in GitPod**

- Set up ReactJS project

### User Story Management

#### Sprints
The project was divided mainly into three main sprints spanning a week.

- **Sprint 1** was to set up Backend be-inspired-drf-api.

- **Sprint 2** was to set up Frontend ReactJS app and connect with backend API (Faced tough challenges, details in Errors and Fix section)
	- Set up axios interceptors, create async handles and connect to backend.
	- Set up Sign Up and Sign In pages
	- Make forms in fronend, input data and push data into be-inspired-drf-api
	- Pull and show data from be-inspired-drf-api

- **Sprint 3** was to set up Frontend ReactJS app pages, styling, functions and fixing bugs and testing.

## Design

### Colours
- The colour scheme has considered based on easy accessibility for all. 
- Complimentarity was key feature in color selection, to give it a pleasant feel for all age groups.
- The colors have been rendered differently for posts and recommendations, so that user can easily distinguish between them.

The palette was generated with inspiration from palettes provided by [Coolers](https://coolors.co/). Simple combinaion of pastel colours were checked and selected. The color palette used is as shown below.
![Color palette](docs/wireframes/be_inspired_color_palette.png)

### Typography

Fonts were imported using Google Fonts. Font "Alegreya Sans" was used throughout with a backup of sans-serif. It was chosen for easy readability for users. 

### Imagery

The imagery on the website has been seleced according to the post requirement.
Many images were taken from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).

### Wireframes
The wireframes were generated at the start of the project suing Balsamiq. After referring to different bootstrap templates, pages were divided into the different relevant sections. 
The finished website closely follows wireframes as the designs were adapted during development but overall structure was kept constant. For eg. an additional 'Liked' page was introduced in order to allo the user to save the posts they liked. 

The wireframes can be found in these links:<br>
[Wireframes for Desktop](docs/wireframes/wireframes_be_inspired_desktop.pdf)<br>
[Wireframes for Tablet](docs/wireframes/wireframes_be_inspired_tablet.pdf)<br>

### Frameworks, Libraries and Programs

**Frameworks and Libraries **
- [React Bootstrap4](https://react-bootstrap-v4.netlify.app/) - for styling the site and site responsiveness across various devices
- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) - to build the functionality of the site
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - to add various icons to the site
- [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) - used for promise-based HTTP. axios was used to send API requests from the React project to the be_inspired_drf_api and avoid any CORS errors when sending cookies.
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/) - library to decode out JSON Web token. JWT prevents unauthenticated user from making extra network requests to refresh their access token. It is also used to remove the timestamp from the browser when the user refreshes token expires or the user logs out.
- [Popper](https://popper.js.org/) - a 3rd party library used by React-Bootstrap to make sure the dropdown menus position is fixed on all browsers.
- [React Infinite Scroll](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-infinite-scroll-component) - to enable component to load content (posts, recommendations and comments) automatically as the user scrolls towards the bottom of the page without having to jump to next/previous page.
- [React Router](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start) - used for dynamic routing. This library enables the navigation among views of various components and control what the user can see depending on the URL they have accessed in the browser.

## Production

Installations:
- React library - using the command `npx create-react-app . --template git+https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/cra-template-moments.git --use-npm`
For the React project set up
- react-bootstrap - using the command `npm install react-bootstrap@1.6.3 bootstrap@4.6.0`
This is used to render the layout and styling of the website. The library makes it easy to create and use standard interface elements that are responsive.
- react-router-dom - using the command `npm install react-router-dom@5.3.0`
 This library makes the site navigation easier without the need to refresh the page. In social media sites ith mutiple components, it provides a quick and responsive user experience.
- axios - installed using command `npm install axios`.It manages the calls to the backend database. Simplifies the API requestsand the included interceptors refresh JSON Web Tokens which the site uses.
- infinite-scroll-component - installed using command ` npm install react-infinite-scroll-component`.
It is used to enable infinite scrolling on the Posts and Recommendations components and on comments. Infinite scrolling is a standard feature in all social media sites.
- jwt decode - Using command `npm install jwt-decode`. Used to remove requests to refresh an access token for signed out users. It enables the refresh token to be decoded so that a timestamp can be put in local storage, if a timestamp does not exist in the user's local storage then access refresh requests will not be made.

## Testing

### User Story Testing

### Testing Technologies

#### Manual Testing
I manually tested all the features of the website making sure to go through them with different browsers and device sizes. I also checked the features of the site against the original user stories and compared them with the acceptance Criteria. All the tests were recorded using LICEcap tool.

CRUD functionality has been tested for the following: Posts, Reviews, Events, Comments, Likes, Follows and Profile on both the development and deployed version of the site
All Nav links open on the correct page
All external links open in a new browser
Authentication works displaying a different set of options for logged-in users compared to logged-out
Pages that are intended for logged-in users only will redirect any users who are not logged in back to the homepage
Validation on forms works
Not found pages display correctly when a non-existent URL is searched or a Post, Review or Event that doesn't exist is searched
All pages are mobile responsive
#### Validation
